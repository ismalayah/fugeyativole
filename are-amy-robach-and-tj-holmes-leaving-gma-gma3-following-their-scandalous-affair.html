Holmes are currently facing. Following, the scandal that revealed the two’s on-screen chemistry was not just for the show, the confirmed couple has been put on hiatus from GMA3. Yet many fans, viewers and otherwise, have been left wondering if the two will ever return to the GMA stage. Here’s everything we know so far.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>How 'GMA' Team Feels About T.J. Holmes, Amy Robach's Possible Return – <a href=#>https://t.co/rp7t4WDNxr</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2GZNBYGfFf</a></p>— HitzMotion.Com (@HitzMotion) <a href=#>January 5, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=756 data-current-count=1056 data-injectable=true>The news first hit the airwaves in November when photos of the two were revealed by <a href=#>The Daily Mail</a>. The pictures were rumored to have been taken by a private investigator hired by Robach’s suspicious husband. It was not a good scene. The photos revealed Robach, 49, and Holmes, 45, canoodling at an intimate NYC bar and holding hands in a ride share. They also included explicit photos of a caress shared by the two while Robach loaded up a car following an intimate lovers’ weekend. Generally, such photos would simply be an up-close look at a happy couple, but there were just one or two little problems. Both of them were married…to other people, although they had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly been separated from their respective spouses since August</a>.</p><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true>Holmes was married to 44-year-old attorney Marilee Fiebig, and the two share one daughter together. Robach was married to former Melrose Place actor 55-year-old Andrew Shue. The two did not share any children, but Robach has two from her previous marriage, and Shue has three from his. Both former couples have filed for divorce. Since then, Robach has made her and Holmes’s relationship even more public, much to the chagrin of Good Morning America.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Amy Robach (@ajrobach)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=819 data-current-count=1119 data-injectable=true>GMA almost immediately put the couple on hiatus during the scandal claiming it was an “internal and external” distraction to the show, as reported to <a href=#>Variety.</a> Deliberations at the studio continued as the scandal grew, and one source reported to<a href=#> US Magazine </a>that “Amy and T.J are out, a decision has been made. The network is negotiating with them on their exit deals and an announcement.” Yet while the affair is certainly infamous, ABC News President Kim Godwin admits that technically the two have not violated any workplace policy, so it is unclear if the network will be able to fire them on that basis alone.<a href=#> US</a> also reported there is a “full investigation underway” at ABC, and Godwin emphasizes that the network is simply looking to do “what is best for the organization.”</p><p data-characters=765 data-current-count=765 data-injectable=true>Although the pair may not have violated any policy, it is possible they did break a “morality clause” outlined in their contracts and agreements. <a href=#>The Sun</a> reported that there is a line in their contracts stating “act at all times with due regard to public morals and conventions,” so says a copy of the document gathered by the newspaper. It goes on to say “which tends to bring you or us into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule…or which might reflect unfavorably upon us, or injure the success of the programs. We may terminate this Agreement upon notice to within thirty (30) days after we acquire knowledge thereof.” It seems Holmes and Robach might be in some very hot water with GMA if this agreement and wording are true.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#BREAKING</a>: <a href=#>#AmyRobach</a> Spotted Out in NYC with Estranged Husband <a href=#>#AndrewShue</a> amid <a href=#>#TJHolmes</a> Romance</p><p>They should make a movie out of TJRobachgate😂<a href=#>https://t.co/qM5XdPZJsK</a></p><p>via <a href=#>@people</a></p>— Emoluments Clause (@Emolclause) <a href=#>January 15, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true>Another source reported to <a href=#>Page Six</a> that “while Robach and Holmes’ contracts haven’t officially been terminated, the anchors are on their way out and have hired lawyers to deal with negotiating their exit packages.” Yikes.</p><p data-characters=669 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true>While the pair’s future on GMA is uncertain, their future as a couple seems quite clear. Despite all the backlash, the two have taken their time off to go on romantic getaways. The two spent the holidays together in Miami, as was revealed by<a href=#> People.</a> While the couple may be living it up, the people they left behind seem to be having a less great time. GMA isn’t the only one giving the couple a hard time about their relationship; the fan backlash has been immense, and Robach’s own stepson posted a photo to Instagram throwing shade at his soon-to-be former stepmother. His father, Andrew Shue, also scrubbed his Instagram of all traces of Robach.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by NATE SHUE (@nathanielshue)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=false>Will we be seeing more of Amy Robach and T.J.

While the reviews may still be fairly mixed, they certainly seem to be leaning towards the two never returning to their former posts and certainly not their former glory. The final verdict, however, remains to be seen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yivsRmmKaxXae8o63CoWSappRiwat5x6ijpp2jYrmmrdWipaBll6KubrPMmmpmnp%2BhubDDyKeeZqyYmrazedKcmKeckaG8tr%2BMmp2fmZmnfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fare-amy-robach-and-tj-holmes-leaving-gma-gma3-following-their-scandalous-affair.html&text=Are%20Amy%20Robach%20and%20TJ%20Holmes%20leaving%20GMA%2c%20GMA3%20following%20their%20scandalous%20affair%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-amy-robach-and-tj-holmes-leaving-gma-gma3-following-their-scandalous-affair.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-amy-robach-and-tj-holmes-leaving-gma-gma3-following-their-scandalous-affair.html&title=Are%20Amy%20Robach%20and%20TJ%20Holmes%20leaving%20GMA%2c%20GMA3%20following%20their%20scandalous%20affair%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fare-amy-robach-and-tj-holmes-leaving-gma-gma3-following-their-scandalous-affair.html&title=Are%20Amy%20Robach%20and%20TJ%20Holmes%20leaving%20GMA%2c%20GMA3%20following%20their%20scandalous%20affair%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fare-amy-robach-and-tj-holmes-leaving-gma-gma3-following-their-scandalous-affair.html&title=Are%20Amy%20Robach%20and%20TJ%20Holmes%20leaving%20GMA%2c%20GMA3%20following%20their%20scandalous%20affair%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-amy-robach-and-tj-holmes-leaving-gma-gma3-following-their-scandalous-affair.html&description=Are%20Amy%20Robach%20and%20TJ%20Holmes%20leaving%20GMA%2c%20GMA3%20following%20their%20scandalous%20affair%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./robert-kraft.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Billionaire, Robert Kraft planning to wed his girlfriend, Dana Blumberg?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./stephen-king-reiterates-that-you-shouldnt-believe-everything-you-see-on-wikipedia.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stephen King reiterates that you shouldnt believe everything you see on Wikipedia">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
