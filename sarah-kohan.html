She also holds a Bachelor of Laws and a Bachelor of Finance degree from The University of Notre Dame Australia. She also attended Harvard and Columbia Universities.</p><p>Sarah’s father is a surgeon, and she initially wanted to follow in her father’s footsteps and become a surgeon as well. She abandoned her studies, however, after discovering her passion for travel.&nbsp;Furthermore, she frequently mentions in interviews that she is of Australian and Romanian descent. Aside from that, Kohan is also fluent in Spanish.

Professional LIfe</h2><p>In terms of career, Sarah revealed that her journey as a travel blogger began in earnest in October 2016. Of course, she had a strong desire to travel and try new things since she was a child. Furthermore, she was always exploring and traveling the world while in college.</p><p>This Australian beauty shared several photos and videos of the exciting moments she had while visiting Tonga. One of those photos, in which she was attempting to get close to a whale while free diving, received a thumbs up from her fans.</p><p>And for this image, she received several positive comments, with people saying that it depicted the relationship between nature and humans. People’s heart-pounding reactions kicked Kohan, and she decided to make a career out of travel.</p><p>Furthermore, her first Instagram video from her travels received a lot of attention, and her followers skyrocketed as a result. As a solo traveler, the blogger has visited Bora Bora, Cook Islands, South America, London, France, Hawaii, Thailand, Maui, and many other destinations.</p><p>Aside from that, Mrs. Hernandez currently promotes a variety of brands, including Kaohs, Frankie, and others.

Javier has also played for some of the world’s best clubs, including Manchester United, Real Madrid, Sevilla, West Ham United, and others.</p><p>To speak of his beginnings as a player, Sarah’s husband began his career with his hometown club Guadalajara and is currently a member of the LA Galaxy.</p><p>In addition, he is the all-time leading goal scorer at the Mexican International Level, with 52 goals for the country.

However, the couple looks stunning together. Meanwhile, the lovey-dovey couple first appeared together in July 2016 when they spent their happy time at Miami Beach. Following that, the couple began to appear together on a number of occasions.</p><p>Aside from that, there was a time when there were rumors that the lovebirds had broken up.
