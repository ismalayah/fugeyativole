With already a record contract for a free agent going to Manny Machado a few days ago, MLB star Bryce Harper topped the list with a whopping $330 Million deal at the last day of February.</p><p>Former <strong>Washington Nationals</strong>’ baseball right fielder, <strong>Bryce Harper</strong> is a prominent figure in the sports genre. Since his MLB debut at the age of 20, Bryce bagged numerous team and personal achievements with the Nationals. And now with the new record-setting deal as a free agent with <strong>Philadelphia Phillies</strong>, Bryce is all set to consume more from his professional career.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Short Bio: Age, Brother, Height</h2><p>Bryce Harper, age 26, was born as Bryce Aron Max Harper on 16 October 1992 to middle-class working parents, <strong>Ron Harper </strong>and <strong>Sheri Harper</strong>. He was brought up alongside his brother, <strong>Bryan Harper</strong> in his hometown of Las Vegas, Nevada. Bryan is also into baseball as he formally played as a pitcher for the Minor League team, Syracuse Chiefs.</p><p>Bryce’s inspiration has always been his hardworking father, Ron, who is an ironworker in Las Vegas. He learns fruitful life lessons from his father’s dedication and determination towards work.</p><p>Standing at the tall height of 6 feet and 3 inches (1.9 m), Bryce went to Las Vegas High School for his early education. Later, he enrolled in the College of Southern Nevada in 2010.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Recent Contract, Net Worth Details</h2><p>The date 28 February 2019 marked history in MLB as Bryce Harper bagged a record contract deal as a free agent. The former Nationals’ right fielder signed a gigantic $330 Million-worth 13-year deal with the Philadelphia Phillies.</p><p>While penning the deal, Bryce snubbed two other offers made by the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers. Bryce’s new contract puts him past <strong><a href=#>Manny Machado</a></strong>’s $300 Million-worth deal with the San Diego Padres. Besides, American player <strong><a href=#>Nolan Arenado</a></strong> is another name in the list of big-prized players amidst his latest $260 Million-worth deal with the Colorado Rockies.</p><p>The latest deal will surely do greater goods for Bryce to strengthen his earnings. For now, the former Nationals’ player amasses around $15 million of net worth. Besides, he is the owner of $2.7 Million home in a community in Nevada, which he bought in 2016.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Career Stats</h2><p>Following a proficient amateur college career, Bryce Harper was picked in the first overall selection of the 2010 MLB draft by Washington Nationals. After some time in the minor leagues, Bryce made his MLB debut against the Los Angeles Dodgers on 28 April 2012. Some 15 days later on 14 May 2012, Bryce recorded his first MLB home run against San Diego Padres.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebspodium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Bryce-Harper.jpg><p><strong>Bryce Harper as Washington Nationals player (Picture: NBC Sports)</strong></p><p>Bryce’s long-haul association with the Nationals has braced him with major personal achievements. He was named NL MVP in 2015 following the NL Rookie of the Year tag in 2012. Besides, his career stats of 610 runs, 184 home runs, 521 RBI, and .279 batting average from 927 MLB appearances speaks for his success itself.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Married Life With Wife-Turned-Girlfriend</h2><p>Bryce Harper enjoys equal bliss in his personal life as well with the company of his wife-of-two-years, <strong>Kayla Varner</strong>. Bryce and Kyla were high school sweethearts as they initiated their romance in 2012. Following that, the pair so in love engaged in 2014 with the plan to walk down the aisle together in 2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebspodium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Bryce-Harper-Nationals.jpg><p><strong>Bryce Harper and his wife, Kyla Varner pose in front of San Diego California Temple on 17 November 2018 (Picture: Bryce’s Instagram)</strong></p><p>However, amidst some circumstances, the soon-to-be man and wife called off their engagement only to redo it in July 2016. A few months later, the long-haul pair shared the wedding vows in a ceremony at the San Diego California Temple on 16 December 2016.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Some Interesting Facts About Bryce Harper</h2><ul><li>Bryce is the fan of NHL side Vegas Golden Knights and he even put the Knights’ logo on his bat during Knights’ run to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2018.</li><li>He became first ever player in MLB’s history to record five Opening Day home runs before the age of 25.</li><li>Bryce’s career achievements include 6 times All-Star team, NL Hank Aaron Award, Home Run Derby Winner and Golden Spikes Award.</li><li>Bryce’s wife, Kayla is also a sportsperson as she played soccer in both her high school and university days.&nbsp;</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FPqJuirZ1jsLC5jqSlqK9dlq%2BwwdNmmauxk5p6qa3RqZyrZZOku7W%2BwJyrZpmXmnqxtMilo6Kdo2LAta3TrGSnnaRixLC%2B06FksKGWmnw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fknow-about-bryce-harper-contract-age-phillies-stats-net-worth-wife.html&text=Know%20About%20Bryce%20Harper%3b%20Contract%2c%20Age%2c%20Phillies%2c%20Stats%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Wife&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fknow-about-bryce-harper-contract-age-phillies-stats-net-worth-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fknow-about-bryce-harper-contract-age-phillies-stats-net-worth-wife.html&title=Know%20About%20Bryce%20Harper%3b%20Contract%2c%20Age%2c%20Phillies%2c%20Stats%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fknow-about-bryce-harper-contract-age-phillies-stats-net-worth-wife.html&title=Know%20About%20Bryce%20Harper%3b%20Contract%2c%20Age%2c%20Phillies%2c%20Stats%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fknow-about-bryce-harper-contract-age-phillies-stats-net-worth-wife.html&title=Know%20About%20Bryce%20Harper%3b%20Contract%2c%20Age%2c%20Phillies%2c%20Stats%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fknow-about-bryce-harper-contract-age-phillies-stats-net-worth-wife.html&description=Know%20About%20Bryce%20Harper%3b%20Contract%2c%20Age%2c%20Phillies%2c%20Stats%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./captured-lyndhurst-man-accused-of-gunning-down-paterson-woman-25.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Captured!
