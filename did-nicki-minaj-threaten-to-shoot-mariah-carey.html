She is with her twins," Walters said. "She doesn't feel that anything would happen. I'm quoting now, 'But Nicki is unpredictable' and Mariah says she can't take a chance and she has hired extra security."</p><p>Check out video of Walters on her conversation with Carey <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p>Minaj's representatives have yet to comment. Not that they need to.</p><p>"Hey yAll. Lets just say nicki said smthn about a gun. ppl will believe it cuz she's a black rapper. Lmao. I'll then hit up Barbara n milk it," the singer <a href=#>wrote on Twitter.</a></p><p>Minaj <a href=#>added</a>, "Ironically no camera or mic heard the gun comment tho. Lol @ the struggle.

Mariah kept at it and called Nicki 'a b**h' and then proceeded to cuss her out. Producers had to stop filming and call it a night."</p><p>What followed was Minaj's expletive-filled rant caught on tape, with fellow panelists <strong>Keith Urban</strong> and <strong>Randy Jackson</strong> caught in the middle.</p><p><strong>'OFF WITH YOUR HEAD'</strong></p><p>The audio quality on the video is dodgy, but according to the website's transcript, Minaj refers to Carey as, among other things, "her f*****g highness."</p><p>"You think I'm playing. Think it's a joke! Think this is a f*****g joke!" says Minaj. "Say one more disrespectful thing to me, if you say one more disrespectful thing to me - off with your head," she screams.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"Excuse me, I am not being disrespectful," counters Carey.</p><p>"Off with your head! Off with your head!" Minaj says.</p><p>"Don't tell me I'm insecure, don't tell me I'm inadequate. You're the insecure one, sittin' up there running down her rÃ©sumÃ© every five minutes," Minaj continues.</p><p>"Every time you take a shot at me I'ma take it back, and if you gotta f*****g problem then handle it. I told them, I'm not f*****g putting up with your f*****g highness over there ... figure it the f**k out. Figure it out."</p><p>Fellow judge Urban, who was sitting between Minaj and Carey, then appears to try and calm the hip-hop star down.</p><p>"Oh why, whyyyyyyyy, do I have a three-year-old sitting around me?" Carey responds.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"I'm not sitting here for 20 minutes and have her run down her resume every five minutes, every day," Minaj snaps, according to the transcript.</p><p>"Listen ... I can't see my kids because you decided to make ... to have ... to have a little baby fit and going all around the stage," replies Carey.</p><p>"Good, well then go see them now, go see them now ... you're boring as f**k, you're boring as f**k," Minaj tells Carey.</p><p><strong>Check out the censored video below:</strong></p><p>Carey's husband Nick Cannon has since spoken out about the teardown.</p><p>"When you think about what the show is actually about and represents ... I feel like it's taking away from the quality of what <i>Idol</i> is all about," the <i>America's Got Talent</i> host told <i><a href=#>Access Hollywood Live</a></i>.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"This is about people accomplishing their dreams, experts guiding these young people to do what they've done," he said.</p><p>"My wife is the strongest and classiest woman that I've ever met," he continued, "if you watch the video, she just maintains her composure ... I don't think she's moved by the theatrics and pageantry of it all. She signed up to do a job to help young people ... this is like a sidebar. I hope that's not what this show becomes, about the catfights."</p><p>He continued: "The show is solely about a singing competition. That's why America loves these shows, they want to see people reach a certain goal or win ... and then to make it about something it's not, [it] kind of shows that the producers and the network are losing their foot a little bit."</p><p>Cannon said when his wife called him after the incident, she was focused on checking in on the couple's one-year-old twins, <strong>Moroccan</strong> and <strong>Monroe</strong>.</p><p>"She called me and we were talking about the kids," Cannon explained. "At the end of the day she's a mum and that's my wife. We got diapers to change and kids to raise.</p><p>"I think that [avoiding on-set drama] was one of her main concerns. [She] signed up to be a mentor on a show that is about people accomplishing their dreams."</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p><strong>'IT WAS INTENSE'</strong></p><p><i>Idol</i> host <strong>Ryan Seacrest</strong> also weighed in on what went down between the divas.</p><p>"There was a very heated, intense argument towards the end of the day after a contestant did a little bit of a performance in the room," he admitted on his <a href=#>KIIS-FM radio show</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>He continued: "It was intense, I'll be honest with you. And it was towards the end of the day, and there were just a few contestants to be seen...So it did get intense, and we did wrap after it."</p><p>Carey last month denied rumours of a feud between her and Minaj, telling reporters, "How can you feud in two days? I think a feud takes a little longer [to build]."</p><p>And while some believe that the videotaped showdown was spun for publicity, a source tells <a href=#>E!
