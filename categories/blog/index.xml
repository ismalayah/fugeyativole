Identified as isopods, the creatures have mutated into carnivores the size of big cockroaches and begin to devour their victims both from the outside in and the inside out — a nice touch, that.
The reasons for the mutation are hinted: run-off from a giant chicken farm, where the poultry feed is laced with steroids, and a possible radiation leak from a nearby nuclear reactor.</description></item><item><title>Best incredibly powerful monotype Pokmon of each type</title><link>/best-incredibly-powerful-monotype-pokemon-of-each-type.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/best-incredibly-powerful-monotype-pokemon-of-each-type.html</guid><description>There are over 900&amp;nbsp;Pokémon&amp;nbsp;for you to catch and collect.

Or is it their nature or the way they’re built? There is so much to consider when deciding which one is the greatest.
