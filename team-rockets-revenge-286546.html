Professor Oak is keeping in touch with updates about the Rocket situation.</p><p>Ash: So, what's happening right now?<br>Oak: You might want to listen to this. I'm detecting a large cluster of Rocket agents gathering outside their headquarters. They must be planning something big.<br>Brock: Thanks for warning us, Professor. We'll be sure to keep an eye out for them.<br>May: Hopefully, we won't have to. There's no way they'll find us here!<br>Max: Oh, I don't know, sis. With Team Rocket, you never know...</p><p>Upon landing, our heroes are greeted by Professor Kukui, who has agreed to house them during their stay in Alola.</p><p>Kukui: Glad you could make it, Ash. Professor Oak has filled me in on everything.<br>Ash: Nice to see you too, Professor Kukui. How are my Pokémon doing?<br>Kukui: I want to surprise them, so I haven't told them you're coming, yet. But I did bring along someone...<br>Rotomdex: Boop beep beep boop! Ash! I am so glad to see you again!!!<br>Ash: So am I, Rotom! What have you been up to?<br>Rotomdex: [puts on wig] Solving mysteries! Alolan Detective Laki has been showing new episodes all week, and I'm not going to miss a single...wait...IT'S ON IN TWENTY MINUTES!!!! WE HAVE TO GET HOME RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!<br>Kukui: Okay, Rotom! No need to worry. We'll get back in time.<br>May: Your Rotomdex is weird, Ash.<br>Ash: He's not weird, he's just...enthusiastic.</p><p>Later, at the Kukui household...</p><p>Kukui: Guess who's here, everyone!<br>[Ash's Alolan team, who have been sleeping on the floor with Kukui's son, immediately wake up and smother their trainer with affection]<br>Ash: Guys, not so hard!<br>Max: Looks like Ash's Pokémon really missed him.<br>Ash: I'm sure you guys know Brock, but these are my other two friends, May and Max.<br>Max: Nice to meet-OW!<br>[Rowlet starts pecking Max]<br>May: What's the matter?<br>Max: This little guy is pecking my foot!<br>Ash: That's my Rowlet. I guess he's really happy to meet you, Max.<br>[Ash's Melmetal approaches May and points to his back]<br>Melmetal: Metal?<br>May: Say what?<br>Ash: Melmetal wants to know if he can give you and Max a ride on his back.<br>May: That won't hurt him, will it?<br>Kukui: Of course not! Melmetal's a Steel Type. He can handle it.<br>May: Well, okay.<br>[Melmetal lets May and Max climb on]<br>Max: Wow, I've never rode on a Steel Type before! This is fun!<br>May: Yeah, you're a really cool Pokémon, Melmetal!<br>[Melmetal blushes]<br>Brock: I hope you won't mind me asking, Professor, but, whose child is that?<br>Kukui: Oh, that's our son, Lei. He loves when we have visitors.<br>Ash: Where's Professor Burnet?<br>Kukui: She's been helping out at Aether Paradise for a few days. You'll probably see her tomorrow.<br>Brock: Wait, who was watching him when you came to pick us up?<br>Kukui: Ash’s Pokémon did, of course! They’re really close with him.<br>[Incineroar winks at Lei]<br>Lei: Kitty!<br>Max: Whoa, the baby just said something!<br>Kukui: Yeah, he’s been learning how to say the Pokémon’s names lately. Now if only I could get him to learn my name…<br>May: Hey, guys, is it just me, or did we forget something back at the airport?</p><p>Elsewhere, Jessie (who was on a different plane) makes her way through town trying to find the twerps. It’s not easy, since Ash didn’t bother giving her directions to the house.</p><p>Jessie: This is exactly what I was afraid would happen. Those twerps aren’t going to hear the end of it when I catch up to them!</p><p>Suddenly, a familiar face lands in front of Jessie and grabs her.</p><p>Jessie: Bewear? I never thought I’d be happy to see you again. Can you take me to the twerps?</p><p>Bewear nods her head and runs off towards a nearby beach.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ash and the others are relaxing by the shore. Brock and his Swampert are enjoying the cool ocean water. Kukui prepares a nice barbecue, while Lei plays with Ash’s Pokémon. Their peaceful gathering is suddenly interrupted by an out of breath Jessie and Bewear.</p><p>Jessie: [panting] Finally…I’ve caught up with you.<br>Kukui: What’s she doing here?!? She’s one of those criminals from Team Rocket, right?<br>Jessie: For your information, Professor Kahuna, I’m a good guy now. And I expect to be treated like one!<br>Kukui: Is this true?<br>Brock: Yeah. She couldn’t take their increasingly violent attacks anymore, so she left.<br>Kukui: Well, if you guys say so. But, I still have my doubts.</p><p>Back at the airport, another plane lands. This one, however, has James, Meowth, and Harley on board.</p><p>Harley: Ooh, we’re finally here! I can’t wait to see those beautiful beaches!<br>James: No, Harley. That’s not why we’re here! We’re supposed to be taking over, remember?<br>Harley: But how are we doing to do that when there’s only three of us?<br>James: Don’t ask me, ask Dr. Mambo! He’s the one who assigned us to this place!<br>[James’ Rotom Phone rings]<br>James: Hello?<br>Namba: IT’S NAMBA!!!!!<br>Harley: Um, how did he hear you?<br>Namba: I have eyes and ears everywhere…</p><p>And he’s right. A nearby person turns “his” head around to reveal a secret spy camera.</p><p>Back at the beach, Kukui’s barbecue is ready. All of the Pokémon dig in while Ash prepares to eat his food.</p><p>Ash: Down the hatch!<br>Kukui: Do you always have to say that before you eat?<br>Ash: No…but it sure is fun to say it!<br>Max. Eh, not really.<br>[May prepares to eat her steak, but Incineroar takes a huge chunk out of it]<br>May: Hey! What did he do that for?!??<br>Kukui: I guess I should’ve warned you, May. Incineroar loves to eat, especially when steak is on the menu.<br>May. Tell him not to do it again! I refuse to eat anything that has cat fur in it!</p><p>Suddenly, a strange round object falls on the table. It has a big letter “R” on it, which then disappears and is replaced by a ticking timer, accompanied by a poorly-accented English voice saying, “Bye-bye!” over and over.</p><p>Kukui: BOMB!!! GET AWAY FROM THE TABLE, EVERYONE!</p><p>Everyone gets away from the table just as it goes KA-BLAMMO!!!!!! Dinner plates and burnt pieces of food litter the beach, and Kukui’s glasses have been blown off by the force of the blast.</p><p>Kukui: Is everyone okay?<br>Brock: I think so. Where’s Ash?<br>Ash: [muffled] You’re sitting on me, Brock.<br>Brock: Whoops. Sorry, Ash.<br>Max: Who would ruin our dinner like that?</p><p>In the midst of the smoke, they can just make out some familiar voices taunting them…</p><p>Harley: Prepare for trouble, we’ve ruined your dinner!<br>James: Make it double, now you’ll all be thinner!<br>Harley: To protect the world from devastation…<br>James: To unite all peoples within our nation…<br>Harley: To denounce the evils of truth and love…<br>James: To extend our reach to the stars above…<br>Harley: It’s me, Harley!<br>James: And James, too!<br>Harley: Team Rocket blasts off at the speed of light!<br>James: Surrender now, or you’re in for a brutal fight!<br>Meowth: Dat’s right!<br>Mime Jr: Mime mime mime!<br>James: Hmmm, it doesn’t work as well without Jessie and Wobbuffet.<br>Ash: What do you guys want? We specifically came to Alola just so we could get away from you!<br>Jessie: Go away, you two! I told you I’m not part of Team Rocket anymore. How did you find us anyway?<br>Harley: Look, it’s just a coincidence that you guys happened to be here. Our new boss, Dr. Namba, sent us to take over!<br>Kukui: Dr. Who?<br>Brock: He’s a messed up scientist who tortured an innocent Lugia and her baby!<br>Max: And he tried to fuse Pokémon together so he could sell them to the public at a high price!<br>Kukui: Whoever this guy is, he’s not welcome here, and neither are you. Get off of my property or I’m calling the police.<br>Harley: Did you hear that, James? He’s gonna call the cops!<br>James: Ooh, I’m soooo scared! What next, you’re gonna tell your mommy?<br>Harley: Speaking of mommies, who’s that young man over there?<br>[Harley is referring to Lei, who’s hiding behind his father]<br>Kukui: I don’t know what you two are planning, but leave my son out of this.<br>James: Your son??? Hmmmm, maybe the boss would like an extra prisoner once we capture all of your Pokémon.<br>Kukui: If you put a single hand on Lei, I’ll make sure to rip your arm off!<br>Ash: Wow, I’ve never seen the Professor get so angry before.<br>Rotomdex: He is very protective of Lei, just as a good father should be.<br>Kukui: Since it doesn’t look like you guys are going to leave willingly, what do you say we have a battle?<br>Harley: That can be arranged! Go, Cacturne!<br>James: Go, Carnivine! [CHOMP!] Eeeee!!!! How many times do I have to tell you not to bite me??<br>Kukui: I could use some help here, kids.<br>Ash: We’ve got your back, Professor! Go, Pikachu!<br>Brock: Go, Forretress!<br>May: Go, Blaziken!<br>Ash: What about you, Jessie? You’re on our side now, right?<br>Jessie: I choose Gourgeist!<br>Lycanroc: Roc! Roc!<br>Brock: Ash, I think your Alolan Pokémon want to help out, too.<br>Ash: Sure, guys! It’s been a while since I battled with you.<br>Harley: Are you ready to lose, kiddies?<br>Ash: I’m always ready!</p><p>Author’s note: This is such an eventful chapter that I had to split it into two parts. The next one will see the actual battle, and its horrific consequences.</p><p>I should also point out that I initially wrote this story back in 2019, before Sun and Moon’s finale aired. Some parts of it have been updated slightly to reflect that, but you hopefully won’t notice.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy1scCmZKunk6Cytb%2BMq5yvnZ6csm9%2Bl29sbW5f</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fteam-rockets-revenge-286546.html&text=Team%20Rockets%20Revenge%20%28COMPLETE%29%20%7c%20Bulbagarden&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fteam-rockets-revenge-286546.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fteam-rockets-revenge-286546.html&title=Team%20Rockets%20Revenge%20%28COMPLETE%29%20%7c%20Bulbagarden" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fteam-rockets-revenge-286546.html&title=Team%20Rockets%20Revenge%20%28COMPLETE%29%20%7c%20Bulbagarden" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fteam-rockets-revenge-286546.html&title=Team%20Rockets%20Revenge%20%28COMPLETE%29%20%7c%20Bulbagarden" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fteam-rockets-revenge-286546.html&description=Team%20Rockets%20Revenge%20%28COMPLETE%29%20%7c%20Bulbagarden" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sami-zayn-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Sami Zayn's Net Worth as of 2023?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./primary-colors-1998.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Primary Colors movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1998)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
